# README



## Overview

The assignment requires that I access a dataset entitled "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" and perform various operations to extract, filter, transform, tidy and describe it. A full description of the original datset can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and I have  added the README from the original daatset at the bottom of this document as a reference.

## The Task

My task involves creating an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

I have addressed these steps as follows.

## Step 0 - Initialisation

This is a pre-requisite to the stated 5 steps.  Here I set up my working directory, initialise required libraries and read in the files that describe the columns and rows of the primary dataset.

As part of this step I also tidy the column names by removing and replacing characters ("()" removed, hyphens replaced with underscores, mean to Mean and std to StDv)


## Step 1 - Merge

The 3 test and 3 train files were read to tables and the rows combined for each of the 3 pairs.

The three resultant tables were then combined with descriptive rows preceding variable rows.

## Step 2 - Extract mean and Standard deviation

Based on the standardised columns names those with _Mean or _StDv were extracted

## Step 3 - Activity Descriptions added

Using "merge" the ActivityDescriptions were added

## Step 4 - Appropriate labelling

This was done in both the initialisation process as described above and with the addition "_average" in the resulting "TidyData" summary file.

## Step 5 - Tidy Data file

Produced with the aggregate function and verified as in the correct order (ie Activity then Subject)

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

## For each record it is provided:


- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

## The dataset includes the following files:


- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

## The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

## Notes: 

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
